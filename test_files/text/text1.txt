**1. Executive Summary**
The project is progressing, though some new challenges have emerged since the last report.
Phase 1 milestones are largely on track. The development team has begun implementation
of the core modules. User interface mockups (v2) incorporating client feedback
are now finalized. The previously reported hardware procurement delay has been resolved.
A new critical risk regarding third-party API stability has been identified.
Overall sentiment remains cautiously optimistic.

**2. Key Accomplishments This Period**
- Core architecture design: COMPLETED (No change)
- UI Mockups v2: COMPLETED and APPROVED (Updated post-feedback)
- Database schema v1.1: REVISED (Minor adjustments for performance)
- Initial user testing plan: FINALIZED and SHARED
- Authentication module development: IN PROGRESS (25% complete)
- Staging environment: SETUP (Hardware arrived and configured)

**3. Current Challenges and Risks**
- Resource allocation for Phase 2: This remains an ongoing concern. Mitigation plan A is
  being actively pursued.
  Risk: Potential delay in Phase 2 kickoff if key personnel are not available by May 30th.
- Integration with legacy systems: Investigation complete. A middleware solution is proposed.
  Risk: Reduced to Low. Middleware development effort estimated at 10 person-days.
- NEW: Third-party API stability: The primary external API provider experienced two outages
  this week (total 4 hours downtime).
  Risk: Critical. Contingency plan involving a secondary API provider is being drafted.
  Immediate Action: Monitoring API uptime closely.

**4. Upcoming Milestones (Next 2 Weeks)**
- Complete development of authentication module (Target: 75%).
- Begin development of user profile management module.
- Finalize API documentation for external services and internal modules.
- Conduct first round of internal testing on the authentication module.
- Begin drafting Phase 2 detailed project plan.

**5. Budget Overview**
Current expenditure is within 2% of the allocated budget for Phase 1.
The proposed middleware solution for legacy system integration will incur an estimated
additional cost of $5,000. This is being reviewed for approval.
No other major budget deviations anticipated for Phase 1.

**6. Team Morale and Feedback**
Team morale is stable. The resolution of the hardware issue was well-received.
The new risk concerning the third-party API has caused some anxiety, but the team
is focused on developing contingency measures.
An informal team-building event is scheduled for next week.
Regular feedback sessions are ongoing and constructive.

**7. Client Feedback**
The client appreciated the quick turnaround on UI Mockup v2 and the transparency
regarding the new third-party API risk. They have approved the proposed middleware
solution in principle, pending cost confirmation.
Next review meeting scheduled for May 27th (rescheduled).

**8. Security Considerations**
- All sensitive data handling procedures are being reviewed.
- Penetration testing scheduled for Phase 1 completion.
